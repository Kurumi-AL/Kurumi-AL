## Graduating April 2023

## Welcome to my Github ðŸ˜„

Hello! I am Bachelor of Computer Science student at Brigham Young University.

### What interests me?
I love creating websites with technologies such as React.js and Firebase that are user friendly and fun to use.  
I'm desipline and a hard worker, and this helped me learn new skills by myself.

### What do I value?
> Be the best version of you.

I always compared myself to others, but I realized that the most important thing is to do my best so that I can be at least a little bit better than I was the last day.
